currentTasks array contains list of taskID of allUserTasks(ie TaskOuterData) and contains max 4 items.  Everythime the android app is open i will check the currentTasks if empty then will createTasks and if not empty then will check if the task should be currently Assigned from its created Timestamp ie(daily should change the next day and so on)

If a task is completed than the TaskOuterData would contain a postID with a non null string.

completedTasks contains the list of taskID of allUserTasks with non null post ID
